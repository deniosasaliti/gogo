# Requirements

The **Red5 Pro HTML SDK** is intended to communicate with a [Red5 Pro Server](https://www.red5pro.com/), which allows for broadcasting and consuming live streams utilizing [WebRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/WebRTC) and other protocols, including [RTMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_Messaging_Protocol) and [HLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming).

As such, you will need a distribution of the [Red5 Pro Server](https://www.red5pro.com/) running locally or accessible from the web, such as [Amazon Web Services](https://www.red5pro.com/docs/server/awsinstall/).

# Publisher Types

The following publisher types / protocols are supported:

* [WebRTC](#webrtc) (using [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API), [WebRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/WebRTC), [getUserMedia](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia) and the HTML5 [video](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video) Element)
* [RTMP](#flashrtmp) (using the custom Flash-based publisher developed for Red5 Pro)

Additionally, the **Red5 Pro HTML SDK** allows for automatic detection and failover to determine the correct publisher option to use based on desired order and browser support. To learn more, visit the [Auto Failover](#failover-publisher) section.

## WebRTC

The Red5 Pro HTML SDK WebRTC Publisher solution utilizes WebSockets and WebRTC support in modern browsers.

_It is *highly* recommended to include [adapter.js](https://github.com/webrtcHacks/adapter) when targeting the WebRTC publisher._

> WebRTC-based Publishers need to be delivered over HTTPS due to browser security restrictions related to `getUserMedia` which accesses the Camera and Microphone of your machine. [Read more here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security/deprecating-powerful-features-on-insecure-origins).

### WebRTC Example

_index.html_:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Recommended shim for cross-browser WebRTC support. -->
    <script src="https://webrtchacks.github.io/adapter/adapter-latest.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- `autoplay` will immediately show preview video. `muted` will mute the audio to avoid feedback noise. -->
    <video id="red5pro-publisher" autoplay muted></video>
    <!-- Exposes `red5prosdk` on the window global. -->
    <script src="lib/red5pro/red5pro-sdk.min.js"></script>
    <!-- Example script below. -->
    <script src="main.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

_main.js_:

```js
(function (red5prosdk) {

  // Create a new instance of the WebRTC publisher.
  var publisher = new red5prosdk.RTCPublisher();

  // Initialize
  publisher.init({
      protocol: 'ws',
      port: 5080,
      host: 'localhost',
      app: 'live',
      streamName: 'mystream',
      rtcConfiguration: {
        iceServers: [{urls: 'stun:stun2.l.google.com:19302'}],
        iceCandidatePoolSize: 2,
        bundlePolicy: 'max-bundle'
      }, // See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/RTCPeerConnection#RTCConfiguration_dictionary
      streamMode: 'live',
      mediaElementId: 'red5pro-publisher',
      bandwidth: {
        audio: 56,
        video: 512
      },
      mediaConstraints: {
        audio: true,
        video: {
          width: {
            exact: 640
          },
          height: {
            exact: 480
          },
          frameRate: {
            min: 8
            max: 24
          }
        }
      }
    })
    .then(function() {
      // Invoke the publish action.
      return publisher.publish();
    })
    .catch(function(error) {
      // A fault occurred while trying to initialize and publish the stream.
      console.error(error);
    });

})(window.red5prosdk);
```

Because this example demonstrates publishing to a Red5 Pro Server located on `localhost`, we set the *protocol* to `ws` and *port* to `5080`, which are the default values for non-secure socket connection. If you are publishing to a remote Red5 Pro Server, it will need to be delivered securely - upon which you can rely on the default property values of `wss` and `443`, respectively.

The `video` or `audio` element has the `autoplay` and `muted` attributes defined. This will ensure:

* `autoplay`: Once access to your Camera and Microphone are available, it will show a preview of your broadcast to yourself.
* `muted`: You don't get noise feedback when you start publishing, since it will mute your _playback_ volume. Your publishing session will still have audio.

### Using mediaConstraints and onGetUserMedia

The Red5 Pro HTML SDK will handle the `getUserMedia` requirements internally to set up your Camera and/or Microphone for a broadcast. As such, you can provide the [Media Constraint](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamConstraints) object to be used.

#### WebRTC mediaConstraints

_The `mediaConstraints` default configuration property for WebRTC Publishers._

```js
{
  audio: true,
  video:{
    width: {
      exact: 640
    },
    height: {
      exact: 480
    }
  }
}
```

Internally, the Red5 Pro HTML SDK will use the provided *Media Constraint* to test if the resolutions requested are supported by the browser. If not, it will find the nearest supported lower neighbor based on the originally provided area dimension(s) of the resolutions.

For example, if you provide the following for `mediaConstraints`:

```js
{
  audio: true,
  video:{
    width: {
      exact: 1280
    },
    height: {
      exact: 720
    }
  }
}
```

... and your browser does not support **720p(HD)**, most likely the nearest neighbor supported by the browser will be either **800x600(SVGA)** or **640x480(VGA)**, and either of those resolutions will be used in your broadcast.

> If you would like to bypass the internal determination of resolution, you can use the `onGetUserMedia` override of the configuration properties.

#### onGetUserMedia

The `onGetUserMedia` method - when defined on the configuration provide to a WebRTC-based Publisher - will override the internal call to `getUserMedia` in the Red5 Pro HTML SDK.

You can provide your own logic on how `getUserMedia` is invoked and a [Media Stream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream) attained by setting the `onGetUserMedia` attribute to a method that conforms to the following guidelines:

* No input arguments are provided to `onGetUserMedia`.
* It is *expected* that a `Promise` object is returned.
* A `MediaStream` object must be provided in the resolve of the `Promise`.
* The error provided in the reject of the `Promise` is optional, but recommended as a `String`.

An example of providing `onGetUserMedia` as a configuration:

```js
{
  host: "localhost",
  protocol: "ws",
  port: 5080,
  streamName: "mystream",
  rtcConfiguration: {
    iceServers: [{urls: 'stun:stun2.l.google.com:19302'}],
    iceCandidatePoolSize: 2,
    bundlePolicy: 'max-bundle'
  }, // See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/RTCPeerConnection#RTCConfiguration_dictionary
  onGetUserMedia: function () {
    return navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
      audio: true,
      video: {
        width: {
          max: 1920,
          ideal: 1280,
          min: 640
        },
        width: {
          max: 1080,
          ideal: 720,
          min: 360
        }
      }
    })
  }
}
```

> The `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` API returns a `Promise`, but you can define any other method, as long as it returns a `Promise` and provides a `MediaStream` on resolve.

Be aware that overriding `onGetUserMedia` you are losing the logic from the Red5 Pro HTML SDK that attempts to pick the optimal resolution supported by your browser. **Use with descretion.**

> To read more about `getUserMedia` please read the following document from Mozilla Developer Network: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia)

# Auto Failover and Order

While you can specifically target a publisher - as described in the previous sections for [WebRTC Publisher](#webrtc-publisher) and [Flash/RTMP Publisher](#flashrtmp-publisher) - you may want to let the Red5 Pro HTML SDK select the optimal publisher based on browser support for the technologies.

As you may have noticed form the previous sections, the source configuration for each publisher has differing property requirements. This is due simply to the technologies and broadcast strategies that each use:

* The **WebRTC** player utilizes [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API), [WebRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/WebRTC) and  [getUserMedia](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia) to publish a video and to be displayed in an [HTML5 video](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video) element.
* The **Flash/RTMP** player utilizes a SWF file to broadcast and view streaming video from the Flash Player plugin.

As such, the **init** configuration provided to the library to allow for auto-failover player selection should be provided with attributes defining the target source(s) - i.e., `rtc` and/or `rtmp`:

_index.html_:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Recommended shim for cross-browser WebRTC support. -->
    <script src="https://webrtchacks.github.io/adapter/adapter-latest.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <video id="red5pro-publisher" autoplay muted></video>
    <!-- Exposes `red5prosdk` on the window global. -->
    <script src="lib/red5pro/red5pro-sdk.min.js"></script>
    <!-- Example script below. -->
    <script src="main.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

_main.js_:

```js
...
(function (red5prosdk) {

  // Create a new instance of the failover publisher.
  var publisher = new red5prosdk.Red5ProPublisher();

  // Set publish order and initialize
  publisher
    .setPublishOrder(['rtc', 'rtmp'])
    .init({
      "rtc": {
        // See above documentation for WebRTC source option requirements.
      },
      "rtmp": {
        // See above documentation for RTMP source option requirements.
      }
    })
    .then(function(selectedPublisher) {

      // Publisher implementation determined based on order and browser support.
      return selectedPublisher.publish();
    })
    .then(function() {
      // Publishing has initiated successfully.
    })
    .catch(function(error) {
      // An error occurred witin the initialization and publish process.
    });

})(window.red5prosdk);
```

# Lifecycle Events

This section describes the events dispatched from the Publisher of the Red5 Pro HTML SDK.

* [Listening to Publisher Events](#listening-to-publisher-events)
* [Common Events](#common-events)
* [WebRTC Publisher Events](#webrtc-publisher-events)
* [RTMP Publisher Events](#rtmp-publisher-events)

## Listening to Publisher Events

The Publisher(s) included in the SDK are event emitters that have a basic API to subscribing and unsubscribing to events either by name or by wildcard.

To subscribe to all events from a publisher:

```js
function handlePublisherEvent (event) {
  // The name of the event:
  var type = event.type;
  // The dispatching publisher instance:
  var publisher = event.publisher;
  // Optional data releated to the event (not available on all events):
  var data = event.data;
}

var publisher = new red5prosdk.RTCPublisher();
publisher.on('*', handlePublisherEvent);
```

> The `*` type assignment is considered a "Wildcard" subscription - all events being issued by the publisher instance will invoke the assign event handler.

To unsubscribe to all events from a publisher after assinging an event handler:

```js
publisher.off('*', handlePublisherEvent);
```

The following sections of this document describe the event types that can also be listened to directly, instead of using the `*` wildcard.

## Common Events

The following events are common across all Publisher implementations from the Red5 Pro HTML SDK. They can be accessed from the global `red5prosdk` object from the `PublisherEventTypes` attribute.

| Access | Name | Meaning |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| CONNECT_SUCCESS | 'Connect.Success' | When the publisher has established a required remote connection, such as to a WebSocket or RTMP-based server. |
| CONNECT_FAILURE | 'Connect.Failure' | When the publisher has failed to establish a required remote connection for streaming. |
| PUBLISH_START | 'Publish.Start' | When the publisher has started a broadcast stream. |
| PUBLISH_FAIL | 'Publish.Fail' | When the publisher has failed to start a broadcast stream. |
| PUBLISH_INVALID_NAME | 'Publish.InvalidName' | When the publisher is rejected from starting a broadcast stream because the `streamName` provided is already in use. |
| UNPUBLISH_SUCCESS | 'Unpublish.Success' | When the publisher has successfully closed an active broadcast stream. |
| PUBLISH_METADATA | 'Publish.Metadata' | When the publisher receives metadata from the server. |
| CONNECTION_CLOSED | 'Publisher.Connection.Closed' | Invoked when a close to the connection is detected. |
| DIMENSION_CHANGE | 'Publisher.Video.DimensionChange' | Notification when the Camera resolution has been set or change. |

## WebRTC Publisher Events

The following events are specific to the `RTCPublisher` implementation and accessible on the global `red5prosdk` object from the `RTCPublisherEventTypes` attribute. These events are dispatched during the lifecycle of thre trickle ICE functionality required to start a broadcast:
| Access | Name | Meaning |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| CONSTRAINTS_ACCEPTED | 'WebRTC.MediaConstraints.Accepted' | When constraints have been accepted from the internal request to `getUserMedia`. The `data` property of this event contains a `requested` object detailing the constraints used in the `getUserMedia` request and an `accepted` object which is the current constraint settings for the media. |
| CONSTRAINTS_REJECTED | 'WebRTC.MediaConstraints.Rejected' | Then constraints have been rejected from the internal request to `getUserMedia`. The `data` property of this event contains a `constraints` object detailing the constraints that were used and rejected from `getUserMedia`. |
| MEDIA_STREAM_AVAILABLE | 'WebRTC.MediaStream.Available' | When the negotation process has returned a `MediaStream` object to use. |
| PEER_CONNECTION_AVAILABLE | 'WebRTC.PeerConnection.Available' | When the negotation process has produced a valid `PeerConnection`. |
| OFFER_START | 'WebRTC.Offer.Start' | When the publisher requests to send an offer using a `SessionDescription` on the `PeerConnection`. |
| OFFER_END | 'WebRTC.Offer.End' | When the publisher has received an answer from the `SDP` offer on the `PeerConnection`. |
| ICE_TRICKLE_COMPLETE | 'WebRTC.IceTrickle.Complete' | When the negotaiton process (a.k.a. trickle) has completed and the publisher will attempt at opening a broadcast stream. |

## RTMP Publisher Events

The following events are specific to the `RTMPPublisher` implementation and accessible on the global `red5prosk` object from the `RTMPPublisherTypes` attribute:

| Access | Name | Meaning |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| EMBED_SUCCESS | 'FlashPlayer.Embed.Success' | When the publisher-based SWF is successfully embedded in the page. |
| EMBED_FAILURE | 'FlashPlayer.Embed.Failure' | When the publisher-based SWF fails to be embedded properly in the page. |

# Requirements

The **Red5 Pro HTML SDK** is intended to communicate with a [Red5 Pro Server](https://www.red5pro.com/), which allows for broadcasting and consuming live streams utilizing [WebRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/WebRTC) and other protocols, including [RTMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_Messaging_Protocol) and [HLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming).

As such, you will need a distribution of the [Red5 Pro Server](https://www.red5pro.com/) running locally or accessible from the web, such as [Amazon Web Services](https://www.red5pro.com/docs/server/awsinstall/).

> **[Click here to start using the Red5 Pro Server today!](https://account.red5pro.com/login)**

# Subscriber Types

The following subscriber types / protocols are supported:

* [WebRTC](#webrtc) (using [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API), [WebRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/WebRTC) and the HTML5 [video](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video) Element or HTML5 [audio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio) Element).

* [RTMP](#flashrtmp) (using the custom Flash-based player developed for Red5 Pro)
* [HLS](#hls) (using the HTML5 Video/Audio Element)

Additionally, the **Red5 Pro HTML SDK** allows for automatic detection and failover to determine the correct playback option to use based on desired order and browser support. To learn more, visit the [Auto Failover](#auto-failover-and-order) section.

## WebRTC

The Red5 Pro HTML SDK WebRTC Subscriber solution utilizes WebSockets and WebRTC support in modern browsers.

_It is *highly* recommended to include [adapter.js](https://github.com/webrtcHacks/adapter) when targeting the WebRTC subscriber._

    console.error(error)
  });

})(window.red5prosdk);
```

## Flash/RTMP

The Red5 Pro HTML SDK Flash-based Subscriber embeds a SWF file - utilizing [swfobject](https://github.com/swfobject/swfobject) - to incorporate playback over RTMP.

The **Red5 Pro HTML SDK** supports the following SWF integration:

* A bare-bones RTMP playback viewer - included in the `src` directory as **red5pro-subscriber.swf** - and distributed with the `live` webapp of the [Red5 Pro Server](https://account.red5pro.com/login) install.
  * _Note: You will need to provide a URL to the [swfobject](https://github.com/swfobject/swfobject) library which will be dynamically injected at runtime if not - by default - found relative to the page at `lib/swfobject`._

# Auto Failover and Order

While you can specifically target a player - as described in the previous sections - you may want to let the library select the optimal player based on browser compatibility per support flavors.

## Important Note

It is important to note that the failover mechanism of the SDK is driven by browser support and does not depend on any third-party libraries.

As such, specific failover targets - such as HLS - require native browser support. In the case of HLS, this means failover and playback are limited to Safari Mobile and Safari Desktop when using our SDK.

It is entirely possible to playback streams in HLS using a 3rd-Party library (such as [VideoJS](https://videojs.com/)), but you will not be able to do so while utilizing the Red5 Pro HTML SDK.

> For more information on how to playback HLS in browsers without native support, please refer to the *Using VideoJS for Playback* section of the [Migration Guide](https://www.red5pro.com/docs/streaming/migrationguide.html#migrating-from-350-to-400).

## Initialization

As you may have noticed form the previous section, the source configuration for each player has differing property requirements. This is due simply to the technologies and playback strategies that each use:

* The **WebRTC** player utilizes [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) and [WebRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/WebRTC) to subscribe to a video to be displayed in an [HTML5 video](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video) element.
* The **Flash/RTMP** player utilizes a SWF file to playback streaming video in the Flash Player plugin.
* The **HLS** player utilizes the [HTTP Live Streaming protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Fundamentals/Audio_and_video_delivery/Live_streaming_web_audio_and_video#HLS) to subscribe to a stream.

As such, the **init** configuration provided to the library to allow for auto-failover player selection should be provided with attributes defining the target source(s) - i.e., `rtc`, `rtmp` and/or `hls`:

_index.html_:

```html
<!doctype html>

    <!-- WebRTC Shim -->
    <script src="https://webrtchacks.github.io/adapter/adapter-latest.js"></script>

    </video>
    <!-- Exposes `red5prosdk` on the window global. -->
    <script src="lib/red5pro/red5pro-sdk.min.js"></script>
    <!-- Example script below. -->
    <script src="main.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

_main.js_:

```js
(function (red5prosdk) {

  // Create a new instance of the Red5 Pro failover subcriber.
  var subscriber = new red5prosdk.Red5ProSubscriber();

  subscriber
    .setPlaybackOrder(['rtc', 'rtmp', 'hls'])
    .init({
       "rtmp": {
          // See above documentation for RTMP source option requirements.
        },
        "rtc": {
          // See above documentation for WebRTC source option requirements.
        },
        "hls": {
          // See above documentation for HLS source option requirements
        }
    })
    .then(function(subscriber) {
      return subscriber.subscribe();
    })
    .then(function(subscriber) {
      // `subscriber` is the WebRTC Subscriber instance.
      // playback should begin immediately due to
      //   declaration of `autoplay` on the `video` element.
    })
    .catch(function(error) {
      // A fault occurred in finding failover subscriber and playing stream.
      console.error(error);
    });

})(window.red5prosdk);
```

Important things to note:

* Only `rtc`, `rtmp` and `hls` are supported values for order and are also accessible as enums on `Red5ProVidepPlayer.playbackTypes`

# Lifecycle Events

This section describes the events dispatched from the Subscriber of the Red5 Pro HTML SDK.

* [Listening to Subscriber Events](#listening-to-subscriber-events)
* [Common Events](#common-events)
* [WebRTC Subscriber Events](#webrtc-subscriber-events)
* [RTMP Subscriber Events](#rtmp-subscriber-events)
* [HLS Subscriber Events](#hls-subscriber-events)

## Listening to Subscriber Events

The Subscriber(s) included in the SDK are event emitters that have a basic API to subscribing and unsubscribing to events either by name or by wildcard.

To subscribe to all events from a subscriber:

```js
function handleSubscriberEvent (event) {
  // The name of the event:
  var type = event.type;
  // The dispatching publisher instance:
  var subscriber = event.subscriber;
  // Optional data releated to the event (not available on all events):
  var data = event.data;
}

var subscriber = new red5prosdk.RTCSubscriber();
subscriber.on('*', handleSubscriberEvent);
```

> The `*` type assignment is considered a "Wildcard" subscription - all events being issued by the subscriber instance will invoke the assign event handler.

To unsubscribe to all events from a subscriber after assinging an event handler:

```js
subscriber.off('*', handleSubscriberEvent);
```

The following sections of this document describe the event types that can also be listened to directly, instead of using the `*` wildcard.

## Common Events

The following events are common across all Subscriber implementations from the Red5 Pro HTML SDK. They can be accessed from the global `red5prosdk` object from the `SubscriberEventTypes` attribute.

| AUTO_PLAYBACK_FAILURE | 'Subscribe.Autoplay.Failure' | Invoked when an attempt to `autoplay` on a media element throws a browser exception; typically due to browser security restrictions and their autoplay policies. (WebRTC and HLS, only) [See section on Autoplay Restrictions](#autoplay-restrictions) |
| AUTO_PLAYBACK_MUTED | 'Subscribe.Autoplay.Muted' | Invoked when an attempt to `autoplay` on a media element throws a browser exception and is muted based on the `muteOnAutoplayRestriction` config property; typically due to browser security restrictions and their autoplay policies. (WebRTC and HLS, only) [See section on Autoplay Restrictions](#autoplay-restrictions) |

## WebRTC Subscriber Events

The following events are specific to the `RTCSubscriber` implementation and accessible on the global `red5prosdk` object from the `RTCSubscriberEventTypes` attribute. These events are dispatched during the lifecycle of thre trickle ICE functionality required to start subscribing to a stream:

| Access | Name | Meaning |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| PEER_CONNECTION_AVAILABLE | 'WebRTC.PeerConnection.Available' | When the negotation process has produced a valid `PeerConnection`. |
| OFFER_START | 'WebRTC.Offer.Start' | When the subscriber requests to start an offer on the `PeerConnection`. |
| OFFER_END | 'WebRTC.Offer.End' | When the subscriber has received a `SessionDescription` from a requested offer over the `PeerConnection`. |
| ANSWER_START | 'WebRTC.Answer.Start' | When the subscriber requests to send an answer on the `PeerConnection`. |

| Access | Name | Meaning |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| EMBED_SUCCESS | 'FlashPlayer.Embed.Success' | When the subscriber-based SWF is successfully embedded in the page. |
| EMBED_FAILURE | 'FlashPlayer.Embed.Failure' | When the subscriber-based SWF fails to be embedded properly in the page. |

## HLS Subscriber Events

> There are currently no HLS-specific events. Please refer to the [common events](#common-events).

# Playback Controls

The `4.0.0` release of the SDK introduces Playback API and Default Controls for all subscriber techs with the ability to customize logic and UI for your own branding. To learn more, please refer to the [Playback Controls Documentation](playbackcontrols.md).

# Other Information

## Autoplay Restrictions

In an attempt to provide a more pleasing user experience and reduce data consumption on mobile devices, browsers are continuing to evolve their `autoplay` policies. While generally and attempt to keep websites (read: *ads*) from playing back unwanted and/or unsolicited video and audio, these policies also affect those sites in which the sole intent _is to_ playback video and/or audio - such as from a conference web application built utilizing [Red5 Pro](https://red5pro.com).

Naturally, this can cause some confusion and frustration as `autoplay` may have worked as expected prior to latest browser updates. Thankfully, you do have options when using the *Red5 Pro HTML SDK* to provide a better user experience.

### Using autoplay with the SDK

If supporting autoplay is a requirement for your web application integrating the *Red5 Pro HTML SDK*, you have three implementation choices to choose from:

1. Declaring the `autoplay` and `muted` attributes of the target video element in tandem.
2. Declaring the `autoplay` attribute of the target video element and setting the `muteOnAutoplayRestriction` initialization property to `true`.
3. Delcaring the `autoplay` attribute of the target video element and setting the `muteOnAutoplayRestriction` initialization property to `false`.

#### Solution 1

> Declaring the `autoplay` and `muted` attributes of the target video element in tandem.

By declaring the `autoplay` and `muted` attribute together for a video element, the autoplay functionality will work - the video will begin playback with muted audio.

```html
<video id="red5pro-subscriber" class="red5pro-media" controls autoplay muted playsinline />
```

This is the general recommendation to allow for auto-playback and allow the user to unmute the audio.

> The `controls` and `playsinline` attributes have no correlation to the autoplay policy, but are included for better user experience.

#### Solution 2

> Declaring the `autoplay` attribute of the target video element and setting the `muteOnAutoplayRestriction` initialization property to `true`.

By declaring only the `autoplay` attribute on the video element and setting the `muteOnAutoplayRestriction` initialization property to `true` in the configuration, you can instruct the HTML SDK to:

* first attempt `autoplay` unmuted
* subsequently attempt to `autoplay` muted, if first attempt fails
* send event notification of `Subscribe.Autoplay.Muted`, if auto-playback is muted

Using this solution, `autoplay` can work as desired for browsers that do not enforce the policy (e.g., the policy may differ between desktop and mobile versions of the same browser). For those browsers that do enforce the policy, the *Red5 Pro HTML SDK* will attempt to autoplay the stream. If an exception is thrown on the `play` request of the video element, the SDK will then declare the `muted` attribute on the element on the video element and make a subsequent attempt to autoplay.

If the muted autoplay happens without exception, a `Subscribe.Autoplay.Muted` event is dispatched from the subscriber instance (refer to [Common Events](#common-events)). As a developer, you can handle this method as per your specifications - such as displaying an alert notifying the user that audio has been muted and instructing them to unmute to hear audio.

_declaration of video element in html:_

```html
<video id="red5pro-subscriber" class="red5pro-media" controls autoplay playsinline />
```

_usage of muteOnAutoplayRestriction in initialization:_

```js
var subscriber = new red5prosdk.RTCSubscriber()
subscriber.init({
    protocol: 'ws',
    port: 5080,
    host: 'localhost',
    app: 'live',
    streamName: 'mystream',
    muteOnAutoRestriction: true
  })
  .then(subscriber => {
    subscriber.on(red5prosdk.SubscriberEventTypes.AUTO_PLAYBACK_MUTED, () => {
      alert('Audio has been muted.')
    })
    return subscriber.subscribe()
  })
  .then(subscriber => {
    subscriber.
  })
```

> The `muteOnAutoplayRestriction` property is `true` by default.

#### Solution 3

> Declaring the `autoplay` attribute of the target video element and setting the `muteOnAutoplayRestriction` initialization property to `false`.

By declaring only the `autoplay` attribute on the video element and setting the `muteOnAutoplayRestriction` initialization property to `false` in the configuration, you instruct the HTML SDK to not attempt to:

* first attempt `autoplay` unmuted
* send event notification of `Subscribe.Autoplay.Failed`, if first attempt fails

Using this solution, `autoplay` can work as desired for browsers that do not enforce the policy (e.g., the policy may differ between desktop and mobile versions of the same browser). For those browsers that do enforce the policy, the *Red5 Pro HTML SDK* will dispatch a `Subscribe.Autoplay.Failed` event from the subscriber instance (refer to [Common Events](#common-events)). As a developer, you can handle this method as per your specifications - such as displaying an alert notifying the user that autoplay did not occur and they will need to press the play button to begin playback.

_declaration of video element in html:_

```html
<video id="red5pro-subscriber" class="red5pro-media" controls autoplay playsinline />
```

_usage of muteOnAutoplayRestriction in initialization:_

```js
var subscriber = new red5prosdk.RTCSubscriber()
subscriber.init({
    protocol: 'ws',
    port: 5080,
    host: 'localhost',
    app: 'live',
    streamName: 'mystream',
    muteOnAutoRestriction: false
  })
  .then(subscriber => {
    subscriber.on(red5prosdk.SubscriberEventTypes.AUTO_PLAYBACK_MUTED, () => {
      alert('Audio has been muted.')
    })
    return subscriber.subscribe()
  })
  .then(subscriber => {
    subscriber.
  })
```
